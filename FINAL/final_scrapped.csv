"1","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"2","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"3","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"4","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"5","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"6","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"7","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"8","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""

We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"10","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"11","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"12","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"13","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"14","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"15","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"16","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"17","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"18","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"19","Of illegal sand lifting and Dipu Moni’s 15 letters","Wed Oct 25, 2023 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Oct 25, 2023 01:03 PM","Sajjad Hossain","There were no signs of life on the Meghna river as our engine boat cut through the darkness on the night of October 5. It was around 12:30am. This part of Chandpur Sadar upazila had long gone to sleep, and yet the boatman warned against flashing any light or making any sound. ""It might invite danger,"" he said. The fear of drawing any attention was so palpable that the boatman shut the engine after about 20 minutes. The boat was now floating along the current silently.  Soon, about 500 metres away, we spotted some faint lights flickering in a half circle in the middle of the mighty Meghna. A little further, and the lights became clearer, and some sharp sounds pierced the silence of the night. They were all coming from dredgers, now visible, extracting sands evading the eyes of the river police. Only two days earlier on October 3, the river police arrested nine people, and seized a bulk carrier and a dredger for illegal sand lifting in Meghna's Gucchagram area. Both the bulk carrier and the dredger belong to Selim Khan, chairman of Chandpur's Laxmipur Model Union, said Chandpur Deputy Commissioner Kamrul Hasan. In the 2.5km stretch from Chandpur Sadar upazila's Harinaghat to Bahariya, we spotted seven dredgers on the night of October 5. Around the dredgers were two speedboats, patrolling in a close formation to prevent any other vessels or fishing boats from going near. The night was too dark to take photos or videos, and we turned the boat around for our safety. ""All these dredgers are owned by Selim Khan and his family members. Selim Khan's henchmen do not allow even fishing boats in this area at night to keep their sand mining hidden from the public,"" said the boatman whom we are not naming for his safety. Sand lifting in the Meghna is banned since the middle of last year. Still, Selim Khan has been extracting sand from Bahariya, Harina, and Alur Bazar at night, usually from 10:00pm-6:00am, almost regularly, locals and district administration officials say. The extracted sand is then taken to Harinaghat, Munshiganj, Sonargaon, Narayanganj, Dhaka and other places. Selim Khan declined to comment for this story, first saying he was unwell. When pressed, he hung up the call, and did not respond to our calls and text messages afterwards.  THE RISE OF SELIM KHAN Locals say Selim Khan has at least 50 dredgers that can lift an estimated 3 crore cubic feet of sand per month, which is worth at least Tk 6 crore at wholesale level. From a rickshaw-puller in the 1980s, Selim Khan's rise has been astronomical since he found an earnest enabler in Dipu Moni, now the education minister. District Awami League leaders say Selim Khan developed close ties with Dipu Moni after the AL came to power in 2009, and has since been extracting sand from the Meghna. His aggressive and illegal sand lifting over the years has earned him the nickname Balukheko, the Bangla word for someone who  eats sand, figuratively. Documents obtained by The Daily Star show that between 2018 and 2022 alone, he lifted more than 668.33 crore cubic feet of sand from 21 Mauzas of Chandpur Sadar upazila, from where Dipu Moni is elected. Currently, white sand is sold at Tk 2 per CFT at wholesale level. At this rate, the sand he lifted in the last four years is worth at least about Tk 1,337 crore. Although he made hundreds of crores out of the sand business, he did not pay a single taka to the government exchequer. On September 9, the Chandpur district administration ordered him to pay Tk 267.33 crore in 15 days in overdue royalty against his sand lifting from 2018-2022, or face legal action. As of yesterday, Selim Khan did not pay the royalty, the Chandpur DC said. An investigation by The Daily Star indicates that Selim Khan could not have run his sand business without the backing of Dipu Moni, who went as far as writing to the Prime Minister's Office on at least three occasions to promote Selim Khan's cause. The connections between Dipu Moni and Selim Khan have been previously reported by different media, including this newspaper. It resurfaced on the World Rivers Day on September 24, when the now-fired National River Conservation Commission Chairman Manjur Ahmed Chowdhury made a bold assertion. ""River grabbers have political backing. Those who are illegally lifting sand from the Meghna have ties with a female minister from Chandpur,"" he told a seminar in Dhaka, without naming anyone. Other than Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, there is only one female minister in the current cabinet of 25 ministers. This minister is Dipu Moni, elected from Chandpur-3 constituency. Chandpur, which has five parliamentary seats, does not have any other minister, male or female. Last week, the government cancelled Manjur Ahmed's appointment ""in public interest"" less than a month after his comment on the river grabbers, sand miners and their patrons. The gazette notification that cancelled his appointment did not say what that ""public interest"" was, but environmentalists and citizen groups criticised the government decision saying it was against the government's stated policy to save rivers. DIPU MONI: SELIM KHAN'S ENABLER The Daily Star is in possession of documents that show Dipu Moni promoted Selim Khan's sand business with a dogged determination. Between 2015 and 2021, she wrote at least 15 Demi Official letters, known as DO letters, to various government offices so that Selim Khan and his family members can continue and expand their sand business. In letter after letter, she ""specially requests"" the government offices to allow Ms Selim Enterprise, Ms Shanto Enterprise and Ms Brishti Enterprise to lift sand from the Meghna and carry out hydrographic survey to determine the volume of sand in the riverbed that needs lifting ""to improve the navigability"". Selim Enterprise is owned by Selim Khan himself, while Shanto and Brishti enterprises are owned by his son and daughter, respectively. In the eight months between April and November 2015, she wrote seven letters – three to the Chandpur deputy commissioner, two to then shipping minister Shajahan Khan, one to the senior secretary of the land ministry and one to the principal secretary at the Prime Minister's Office. The two letters to the shipping minister were sent on the same day, June 16, 2015. One letter ""specially requests"" the shipping minister to write to the land ministry to allow Selim Khan to lift sand from the Meghna for three years. In the other letter, Dipu Moni asks Shajahan Khan to write to the land ministry and the Chandpur deputy commissioner to allow Ms Brishti Enterprise, Selim Khan's daughter's firm, to carry out a hydrographic survey in the Meghna to determine the volume of sand that needs extraction. Of her six letters in 2019, two were written to the principal secretary at the PMO, two to the secretary of the shipping ministry, one to the secretary of the land ministry and one to the Chandpur DC. On one occasion that year, she wrote three letters on the same day -- two to two ministries and one to the Chandpur DC – asking them to take measures that would facilitate Selim Khan's sand business. Paper trails also suggest that she sought the intervention of the principal secretary at the PMO three times to expedite the approval process when things were not moving as fast as expected. Most recently on August 3, 2021, Dipu Moni wrote to the land secretary, detailing her own letter chain since 2019 and reminding the secretary of a High Court order of 2020 in favour of Shanto Enterprise, the firm owned by Selim Khan's son. Dipu Moni then asks the secretary to ""instruct"" the Chandpur DC and the deputy director of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, Chandpur, to hand over a sand quarry in Bashgari area to Shanto Enterprise for lifting 8.60 crore CFT of sand. Md Nojibur Rahman, the now-retired principal secretary at the PMO who received two letters from Dipu Moni in 2019, declined to comment. ""I do not want to talk about this,"" he said. ""Dipu Moni cannot do this. She has done this in violation of protocol,"" former cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, when asked about her letters to principal secretaries. Dipu Moni, also a joint general secretary of Awami League, denied having any business ties with Selim Khan and his illegal sand mining. In her response via WhatsApp, she also refuted that she financially benefitted from it. Asked why she wrote so many letters for a single person, she said, ""When a union-level party leader, also a chairman, of my area sought my cooperation in legal sand extraction, I gave the aforesaid self-explanatory DO letters on different occasions to assist him in sand extraction from the Meghna to protect navigability and prevent erosion in some areas. ""As an elected member of parliament from the area, it is my responsibility to assist the local government representatives or anyone from my area when they want to do something that is not illegal."" However, local AL leaders said they do not know any other party leaders or businesspersons in Chandpur who enjoy such support from Dipu Moni. 'WE ARE UNDER PRESSURE' But Selim Khan's sand mining is illegal. Citing official records, Chandpur DC Kamrul Hasan said the district administration has never officially leased out any sand quarry to Selim Khan. ""He lifted sand using a court order, which he secured by presenting false information before the court [High Court]. The Supreme Court later cancelled the [High Court] verdict and directed us to collect the royalty,"" the DC added. Dipu Moni claimed she was not aware if Selim Khan's sand business was illegal, even as she wrote 15 DO letters in the span of six years. Last year, the Chandpur district administration abolished 10 sand quarries in the Meghna, citing serious risks of riverbank erosion. But since January this year, Selim Khan has been lobbying to extract sand from these quarries using the influence of Dipu Moni, multiple government officials having direct knowledge of the matter said. ""Selim Khan regularly comes to the DC office to ask why there is a delay in granting the lease. We are under pressure,"" a top official at the DC office said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. ""Since many DO letters came to the DC office in the past, we can very well understand whose influence he is using to lift more sand,"" the official told The Daily Star by phone. On September 17, the Chandpur district administration declared around 415 acres of the Meghna riverbed in Sadar upazila as sand quarry. Leasing it out will allow extraction of around 30 crore cubic feet of sand. This quarry is in Bahariya area, where Selim Khan is a union parishad chairman. Officials at the DC office and local Awami League leaders say Selim Khan is lobbying hard to get the permits to lift sand from there. ""He has been doing this with support from an influential person. Selim Khan cannot do this all by himself,"" said Chandpur district AL President Nasir Uddin Ahmed. Other than sand lifting, Selim Khan's name had surfaced during a nationwide crackdown on illegal casinos in 2019, when he reportedly went into hiding briefly. Currently, he faces a corruption case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission over illegal wealth worth Tk 34.53 crore, and has an embargo on leaving the country. His name also came up, along with Dipu Moni's brother Wadud Tipu, in March 2022 in the alleged corruption in land purchase for Chandpur Science and Technology University. Subsequently in June 2022, Selim Khan was expelled from the Awami League for ""violating party discipline and damaging the party image by mining sand from the Meghna through dishonest and illegal means"". A month after the expulsion, he still joined a local Awami League meeting as a ""special guest"" and Dipu Moni, joining the meeting virtually, still addressed him as the ""president of the union Awami League,"" according to the video clip of the event. Dipu Moni's support for Selim Khan has been a popular subject of discussion and debate within the local Awami League circle for the last one decade. ""Dipu Moni has never looked after the political or business interest of any other local Awami League leaders the way she does in case of Selim Khan,"" Chandpur district AL President Nasir Uddin said. Note: Given Dipu Moni's elaborate response to our questions, we are running her replies separately."
"20","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"21","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"22","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"23","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"24","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"25","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"26","3 Dev projects in Cox’s Bazar: Syndicate finds mines of money","Wed Sep 8, 2021 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Sep 8, 2021 02:47 AM","Mostafa Yousuf","A syndicate of bureaucrats, politicians and officials of Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) in Cox's Bazar have systematically siphoned off Tk 78 crore in public money from three development projects. For two of the projects, they acquired land that was far more expensive than available alternatives, costing the government an additional Tk 48 crore. Around Tk 30 crore more was embezzled in the name of land requisition for another project. The findings, by the Anti-Corruption Commission's Chattogram office, shed light on how powerful syndicates make their fortune at the expense of taxpayers' money. The 750-page probe report, prepared by an investigator in relation to three graft cases involving the three projects, names 44 government officials, including 23 admin cadre officers. They include a former deputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar, former additional deputy commissioner, former UNO, four former and current officials of PBI Cox's Bazar unit, including the SP and ex-additional SP. The gang also includes 23 surveyors, seven kanongos, six additional land acquisition officers and two sub-registrars. In addition, the list names seven political leaders, including Cox's Bazar district Awami League president and secretary, detailing the scale of their involvement and share of responsibility in the fraud. The ACC office in the port city received the report on June 30. Usually, an official submits his report to a deputy director, who then forwards it to the director general (investigation) of ACC. Afterwards, the report is sent to the ACC chairman for approval. Subsequently, it comes back to the investigation officer who then submits it to the court as part of the charge sheet. As of yesterday, the report was still sitting at the desk of Mahbubul Alam, the deputy director at Chattogram ACC office. ""We are reviewing it. As the report is too long, it will take time [to be forwarded],"" said the deputy director when asked about the status of the report a few days back. THE LONG CON The government has undertaken 73 mega projects in this coastal district worth Tk 3.5 lakh crore, and decided to acquire land worth Tk 25,000 crore for the purpose. In its investigation, the ACC found evidence of graft from the very start of three projects involving the construction of a PBI administrative office, a surface water treatment plant for Cox's Bazar Municipality and a Single Point Mooring for Eastern Refinery. For the PBI office and the water treatment plant, the District Land Acquisition Committee (DLAC) led by the deputy commissioner chose disputed sites, overlooking legal barriers. The DLAC acquired 100 decimals of land for Tk 29.29 core at Kolatoli for the PBI office and two acres at Tk 36 crore for the municipality water treatment plant last year. With proper procedures, the total land would have cost a little over Tk 17 crore, the investigator stated in his report. It was a violation of the guidelines under the law for land acquisition and requisition. The guidelines state that the land-requiring body and DLAC representatives must look for an alternative cost-effective site and check whether the land was already acquired by any other government body. As it was later discovered, another government body already acquired parts of the land years ago. And, when it came to compensating the landowners, the syndicate defrauded ordinary people, the ACC investigation found. The graft watchdog found that 15 fake owners received over Tk 29 crore in the name of land acquisition for the PBI office last year. Similarly, posing as landowners, Cox's Bazar Municipality mayor's family members pocketed Tk 36 crore from the water treatment plant project, documents obtained by The Daily Star show. Md Kamal Hossen, former deputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar, now posted at the Local Government Division, and Ashraful Afsar, former additional deputy commissioner (revenue), now posted at the Ministry of Science and Technology, facilitated the payments, the investigator found. In the process, thousands of landowners were denied their rightful compensation. Victims held press conferences and lodged complaints with the land acquisition (LA) office, but nobody paid heed to them. Nazim Uddin, one such victim, said he did not receive any notice for land acquisition, as is the law. When he came to know about it, the acquisition process was already underway. ""As I am the owner, I applied for compensation. But the land acquisition office behaved so rudely that at one stage I lost all hope. Later, in the middle of last year, my caretaker told me that a team of PBI officials led by its high-ups took the land under their control,"" he told this paper. Three top police officials, who supervised the PBI construction project in phases, were fully aware that all the land documents submitted to DLAC were fake, the ACC investigator mentioned in his report. They are Sarwar Alam, current superintendent of police of Cox's Bazar PBI, Md Moniruzzaman, ex-additional SP of the PBI unit now posted in Khagrachhari, and Abdullah Al Mamun, ex-additional SP of the unit now serving at the headquarters of the Bureau. The DLAC, responsible for verifying land-related papers, certified fabricated documents and authorised payments to fake owners, according to papers obtained by this correspondent. GRAFT IN LAND REQUISITION From the Single Point Mooring project, local public representatives and land officials embezzled Tk 30 crore in the name of land requisition, the report said. A Chinese company won the contract to build a depot on 191 acres of khas land requisitioned for this project in Kalamarchara area. Tarek Bin Osman Sharif, chairman of Kalamarchara Union Parishad, and Mosharrof Hossen, chairman of Kutubzum Union Parishad, made a ""deal"" with the company to remove houses and other structures from the land and took Tk 10 crore for the job. They forcibly demolished the houses and evicted the poor people who used to live on the land, though the task of eviction lies with the district administration, according to the ACC investigator. When any immovable property is required temporarily for public purpose or in public interest, the district administration may requisition it in accordance with the law. In case of requisition of immovable property, compensation shall be paid to the rightful owner or owners. But thanks to the collaboration of surveyors, kanongos and land acquisition officials, Tarek pocketed Tk 20 crore, originally allocated by the government for farmers who used to cultivate the 144 acres of land on which the Chinese company built its office, the investigation found. The land officials dropped the real farmers from the government list, thus depriving them of their rightful dues. Contacted, Tarek said, ""I have given my statement to the ACC when they called me. I don't think there was any chance to siphon off money from this project."" Mosharrof said Tarek and representatives from the Chinese company used to determine the compensation. ""As per the deal, he [Tarek] used to receive 10 percent from the total compensation. I have a business partnership with him. The ACC might have found my name this way. Beyond business relations, I don't have any collaboration with him."" ARRESTEES SPILL THE BEAN The Rapid Action Battalion arrested a surveyor named Md Washim in Cox's Bazar on February 18, 2020, and the ACC Chattogram office filed a case two days later. Three middlemen -- Sala Uddin, Kamruddin and Selim Ullah -- were arrested by the ACC separately later that month. They all ""confessed"" that they had paid commission to LA office staffers. The trio admitted to bribing Tk 10,123,000 to two land acquisition officers alongside dozens of surveyors and kanongos. Eleven sacks of documents, including applications of people seeking compensation, cheques and award books, which were supposed to be preserved at the additional deputy commissioner's office, were seized by Rab from their apartments. Their diaries have details of the commission they paid to the LA office staffers. The ACC came to know details about the graft in the three projects after quizzing the arrestees and analysing the seized documents. It found that a surveyor used to work as the ""commission collector"" for the then DC Kamal Hossen and ADC Afsar. Mohammad Edris, an arrested syndicate leader who is also a commercially important person (CIP), confessed to handing over Tk 40 lakh to a PBI inspector for forwarding it to ex-additional SP Moniruzzaman, according to ACC sources. NO ONE DID ANY WRONG! Denying any wrongdoing, SP Sarwar Alam said he had found some discrepancies in the papers. ""I wrote to the district administration to fix the discrepancies. Then representatives from the Roads and Highways Department and the district administration conducted a digital survey and corrected those,"" he claimed. But the ACC did not find any such letter when it analysed land documents relating to the PBI project. Asked about it, Sarwar said he submitted the letter himself and when the investigation officer came to him for land-related documents, he provided him with a copy. But the investigation officer told this paper that he did not get any such letter. Moniruzzaman, ex-additional SP of Cox's Bazar PBI, neither received calls nor replied to the text messages requesting his comments. Another ex-additional SP of the unit, Abdullah Al Mamun, also could not be reached. Documents show that Moniruzzaman submitted the proposal to the administration for land acquisition for the PBI project on March 14, 2018. The proposal included wrong plot numbers and concealed the fact that parts of the proposed site had been acquired by Roads and Highways in 1992. After the proposal was submitted, a joint feasibility report prepared on November 18, 2018, led by the then UNO AHM Mahfuzur Rahman and a police inspector on behalf of PBI, overlooked these issues and certified the papers as genuine. The DLAC led by the then DC Kamal Hossen approved the joint feasibility study and decided to acquire the land bypassing legal issues on January 1, 2019, the investigation officer found. Kamal Hossen, now posted at the Local Government Department as deputy secretary, rejected the ACC findings. ""I know nothing about the allegations. I did everything adhering to the law,"" he told The Daily Star over the phone. Former ADC Afsar, now posted at the Ministry of Science and Technology, said the land selection was solely the business of the acquiring body. They selected the land considering their ""strategic requirement,"" he claimed. ""Land acquisition law has been followed in full while acquiring land for the PBI project,"" he said in a text message to this correspondent. Mahfuzur Rahman, former UNO of Cox's Bazar Sadar upazila, now posted as the ADC of Sylhet, claimed he did not remember anything ""as the land acquisition happened a long ago."" Shamim Hossain, the land acquisition officer, who released the compensation cheques to fake owners in the PBI project, also denied being involved with any syndicate. Cox's Bazar Municipality Mayor Mujibor Rahman, also general secretary of district Awami League, could not be reached for comments over the phone."
"27","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"28","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"29","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"30","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"31","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"32","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."

"34","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"35","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"36","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"37","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"38","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"39","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"40","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"41","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"42","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"43","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"44","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"45","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"46","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"47","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""

We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"49","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"50","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"51","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"52","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"53","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"54","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"55","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"56","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"57","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"58","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"59","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"60","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"61","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"62","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"63","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"64","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"65","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"66","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""

His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"68","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"69","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"70","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"71","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"72","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"73","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"74","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"75","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"76","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"77","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"78","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"79","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"80","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"81","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"82","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"83","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"84","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"85","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"86","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"87","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"88","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"89","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""

We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"91","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"92","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"93","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"94","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"95","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"96","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"97","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"98","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"99","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"100","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"101","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"102","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"103","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"104","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"105","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"106","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"107","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"108","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"109","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"110","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"111","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"112","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"113","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""

We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"115","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"116","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"117","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
"118","Licence to fly: Pilots faked flying records","Mon May 12, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:34 PM","Zyma Islam","One pilot flew only half the hours required to be certified. Another signed off on his own Airline Transport Pilot Licence—the highest level of aviation certification. A third falsified flight records, while a fourth became a ""check pilot"" for an aircraft he had never flown.  The paper trail shows that the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has long been aware of all this, yet all four individuals still retain their pilot licences. One of them is currently a pilot with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, while another is employed as a check pilot at Sky Capital Airlines. A third was previously employed at US Bangla Airlines and the employment status of the other individual is unclear, according to documents and sources. The findings by an internal inquiry by CAAB's safety department raise concerns about aviation safety and may invite scrutiny by international aviation watchdogs such as ICAO or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. Less than half qualified On March 19, 2023, Abdur Rahman Akand, a graduate of the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, got the Airline Transport Pilot Licence, the most advanced pilot certification. CAAB documents show that he had 26 hours and 5 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command unsupervised, and logged 128 hours and 30 minutes of flying as a pilot-in-command under supervision. According to aviation rules,a person must log 250 flying hours, of which 70 hours have to be unsupervised, while the rest of the hours can be flown under supervision. If the candidate has not logged 70 hours of unsupervised flying, they would need to fly 500 hours as a pilot-in-command under supervision. But before being certified as an ATPL, Akand flew only 154.35 hours – less than a third required for such a sophisticated licence, according to the documents he submitted to CAAB as part of the regulator's internal inquiry. The Daily Star has seen the documents. Talking to this newspaper, Akand said his flying hours are in accordance with the law and claimed that pilots from the Air Force are entitled to certain exemptions. When The Daily Star shared the flight records, he said that this was a partial picture, but refused to furnish any records to prove his claim. To compare, The Daily Star also obtained the flight logs of one of his batchmates who had flown the same aircrafts as him, and later became a civil pilot. There is nothing in his batchmate's flight log called ""pilot-in-command under supervision"". Before Akand was certified as an Airline Transport Pilot, he left the Air Force in 2009 under Section 20 of the Air Force Act, his records show. Under section 20, titled ""Dismissal, removal or reduction by Commander of Air Staff or other officers,"" the Chief of Air Staff, or any officer empowered on his behalf can dismiss, or remove a person from the service, or demote him. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan, who took office in August 2024, declined to comment on whether a pilot could get an ATPL with 26.5 hours of flying as pilot-in-command. Instead, he commented on his Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), saying, ""Captain Rahman had requisite P1 [main pilot] hours for CPL."" According to the rules, even a CPL needs at least 70 hours as pilot-in-command, whereas Akand had less than half that. NO EXPERIENCE! Captain Kabir-ul-Alam was allowed to perform an exam flight to be certified as a ""Designated Check Pilot"" for an aircraft called Fokker-50, a CAAB letter from November 5, 2023, shows. A Designated Check Pilot (DCP) is a flight examiner approved by CAAB to perform regulatory duties, acting as a CAAB delegate. However, Kabir never flew on a Fokker-50; he was a type-rated pilot of an earlier version of the aircraft called F-27, the letter reads. Under both ICAO and CAAB rules, for nomination as a check pilot, the candidate must have 750 hours of flying experience as pilot-in-command of the particular plane. His records show he had only completed 14 sessions of flight simulator training of a Fokker-50. A flight simulator is a device that replicates an aircraft's cockpit, featuring computer-generated visuals that simulate the pilot's perspective and the aircraft's movements. This is not a real flying experience. Before taking on this assignment as a ""check pilot"" he was a check instructor in DC10 aircraft. DC10 is a completely different aircraft, and is not even from the same maker. DC10 is by American maker McDonnell Douglas, while F27 is by Dutch maker Fokker. The Daily Star called Kabir over two phone numbers and sent him messages on WhatsApp, which were delivered. He did not respond. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said there have been no violations here. ""This type of aircraft [Fokker-50] is comparatively rare. Very few simulator facilities are there in the world. The number of instructors is also limited. The Bangladeshi company [Sky Capital Airlines] needed to expend more foreign currency to hire a foreign instructor. Capt Kabir had huge experience in other large aircraft as a captain and instructor. He has more than 2,000 hrs in this aircraft. He qualified for the required training in the simulator also,"" he said in a written response. According to Kabir's recommendation letter sent from his employer Sky Capital to CAAB on August 9, 2023, Kabir did not have 2,000 hours on a Fokker-50. False flying records In April 2022, a surveillance team from CAAB found that US-Bangla pilot Captain Nuruddin Al Masood had falsified his flight hour records and forged his logbook certification. On May 9, 2022, CAAB wrote to him stating that the ""findings from your logbook are enforceable offences"" and demanded an explanation. Pilots' logbooks contain detailed records of their flight experience, including the dates, durations, types of flights, aircraft flown, and the specific roles the pilot performed (e.g., pilot-in-command, co-pilot). It tracks the total flying hours, including solo flights, cross-country flights, and night flying hours. Masood claimed that the mistake was inadvertent, so CAAB gave him seven days to submit his corrected logbook, documents show. He did not do so till June 10, 2023, using different excuses, including claiming that he was unable to locate them. When CAAB finally reviewed his logbooks, they concluded that he had falsified his flight hours, with the recorded flying hours several hundred more than the actual hours flown. One of the instances of falsification shows that he logged 762hours as a pilot in the right-hand seat of a DHC-2 aircraft by de Havilland Canada. For large planes, the pilot in command sits on the left, while the one on the right assists. However, DHC-2 is a small aircraft operated by only one pilot – the one on the left. ""DHC-2 is a single-pilot operation aircraft,"" the CAAB investigation report reads. In another instance, CAAB's investigation found that Masood had logged 346 hours in a flight school in the Philippines, between March 27, 2001 and October 18, 2001. However, he was not even allowed to fly in the Philippines after April 30, 2001, and yet he recorded flying hours until October that year, documents show. ""Masood did not fly 346 hours in the Philippines. The certificate sent is fake,"" concluded CAAB. In 2024, the Civil Aviation Authorities of Philippines (CAAP) also wrote to CAAB, confirming that he faked his records. In response to a CAAB letter, the CAAP said it did not find certain flying hours in his records. ""Considering the records the CAAP has in its database, it can be concluded that there were several inconsistencies in the records of Capt. Masood and the total flight time."" Masood still retains his licence. Speaking to The Daily Star, he said he has filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the CAAB findings and hence he would not speak about a sub judice matter. Despite the court challenge, Capt Masood cannot use the privileges of his licence at the moment, CAAB chairman told The Daily Star. Conflict of interest The Daily Star previously reported in 2018 on how Chowdhury Md Zia Ul Kabir, then a director of flight safety and regulations at CAAB, had received financial assistance from US-Bangla Airlines Ltd to take part in a ""type rating"" training on Boeing 737 in Indonesia the previous year. The report noted that such training costs between $26,000-$30,000. CAAB itself proposed that US-Bangla sponsor Zia's type-rating training, a specialised certification process for pilots. Now, a closer look at Zia's licence shows that he signed his own Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. The licence, seen by The Daily Star, was issued on February 4, 2018, and was stamped and approved with his own seal that reads ""Wg Cdr Chy M Ziaul Kabir Director (FS&R)"". When Zia signed his own licence, he was the flight safety regulator charged with ensuring that pilot licences were compliant, exposing a blatant conflict of interest. The Daily Star called Zia on his phone and sent him messages on WhatsApp which were delivered, but he did not respond. Contacted, Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan said that the then CAAB chairman had approved Zia's licence. ""The approving authority of the licence is the Chairman of  CAAB. But the director of flight standards and regulations has to sign the licence after approval,"" said Manjur Kabir, the current CAAB chairman. Commenting on the overall aviation safety, he said, ""There has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"". CAAB is taking all-out measures for compliance with ICAO standards as always."""
"119","Licence to fly: Regulator repeatedly ignored red flags","Sun May 11, 2025 12:13 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 11:52 AM","Zyma Islam","Part 1 Time after time, the internal safety department of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh uncovered irregularities in pilot licencing and raised concerns about aviation safety, only to be overridden by the civil aviation's higher authorities. An internal investigation by the regulator unearthed serious violations related to at least 144 pilot licences issued by CAAB, many from the last two years, according to documents seen by The Daily Star. The findings cast a spotlight on the nation's aviation standards and may attract scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation experts say. One of the most widespread violations by two training academies – Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy – involved pilots being granted licences without completing their mandatory solo flight hours, the CAAB investigation found. Solo flights are a critical component of pilot training, designed to ensure that candidates can operate an aircraft independently and handle in-flight challenges with confidence. Other irregularities involved one pilot certifying himself by signing his own licenceand another being made a ""check pilot"" of a type of aircraft he had not even flown. Several pilots also logged false flight hours to meet licence requirements (Read in Part 2 tomorrow). Meanwhile, a recent inspection by the Anti-Corruption Commission found that written tests for pilots had been conducted using unauthorised software through a private company, which The Daily Star could not find at its official address. There are three types of pilot licences -- Private Pilot Licence (PPL), Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). A PPL is the first step that certifies a person to fly, while a CPL is an additional licence that a person must obtain to become a professional pilot. The ATPL is the highest level of pilot certification, allowing holders to serve as the pilot-in-command of commercial airliners after meeting extensive flight experience and training requirements. Of the 142 individuals who obtained licences in questionable manners, 120 are PPL, 22 are CPL and 2 are ATPL. A concrete figure was not available, but some of them are currently employed at various airlines in different capacities, including in Biman Bangladesh Airlines. RULES OVERLOOKED Galaxy Flying Academy and Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) are two popular flying institutions in Bangladesh. Together, they produce dozens of pilots every year. In the last few years, these two institutions recommended piloting licences for 142 students even though they did not complete their 150 nautical miles (nm) solo flights and 300nm cross-country flights as pilot-in-command, which are prerequisites for getting the PPL and CPL, respectively, the CAAB investigation found. According to CAAB's Civil Aviation Rules and Air Navigation Order, obtaining a PPL requires pilots to complete five hours of solo cross-country flight time, including at least one flight covering a minimum distance of 270km (150nm) with landings at two different aerodromes. Those seeking a CPL must complete a 300nm cross-country flight as pilot-in-command. To qualify as a commercial pilot, they must also undertake a flight covering at least 540km (300nm) and make landings at two different aerodromes. An aerodrome is the space in which aircraft flight operations take place – an airport is within an aerodrome. However, the CAAB investigation found that the pilots graduating from Galaxy and BFA did not follow the planned route, and their flying hours were much less than that mentioned in the syllabus, raising questions as to whether the required skills had actually been tested. Both academies treat Rajshahi airport as their training base for this check. Galaxy students seeking PPL licences flew the Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route. At least 110 such students flew the 150nm solo flight without stopping at Bogura or Saidpur, which is mandatory, shows a letter sent by Galaxy to CAAB in December 2024. Explaining this breach to the aviation authorities, the academy said its students did not make stops at the transit airports because, after shutting off the aircraft, a certified aircraft engineer would need to sign a release form before the plane could take off again. ""Due to a shortage of engineers [at the academy], we are unable to do so,"" said Galaxy. Galaxy also said since Bogura is a restricted military base, prior coordination is required with the air traffic controller for landings, and so they do not land there. In fact, on September 24, 2023, Galaxy had written to the CAAB and sought this exemption citing safety reasons, but the request was turned down. CAAB officials told The Daily Star that the academy was denied the exemption because there is no compulsion to use this specific route; the students are free to fly any route and stop at any airport in Bangladesh. In addition, 10 students from Galaxy seeking CPLs were required to fly 300nm on the Rajshahi-Saidpur-Jashore-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. The students instead flew from Rajshahi to Saidpur and then went back to Rajshahi, and did the same with Jashore. ""The students returned to the base after the first leg to refuel as the endurance did not cover for the whole route,"" the Galaxy letter explained. Aviation experts said that this means the students did not learn the route between Saidpur and Jashore. They also said that the academy could have easily sent a barrel of fuel to Jashore or Saidpur airports. One barrel, currently priced less than $300, would be sufficient to refuel a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172–the planes flown by the students–twice and once, respectively. Bangladesh Flying Academy (BFA) followed a similar pattern. Its students also flew training flights on Rajshahi-Bogura-Saidpur-Rajshahi route; same as Galaxy and, like Galaxy students, they did not stop at Bogura and Saidpur before returning to Rajshahi. In a letter to CAAB on February 26, 2025, BFA justified this and said, ""Bogura is a restricted airport. Therefore, the students flew over the airfield."" All students were also required to fly solo, not with their instructors accompanying them, yet they did exactly the opposite. In an explanation to CAAB, the BFA said, ""Once an aircraft is switched off Saidpur, a pilot or an engineer needed to sign the documents for transition; therefore, a safety pilot was onboard.""  Aviation experts within the CAAB told The Daily Star that BFA could have simply had a pilot or an engineer present, for only about Tk 60,000 a month, on the ground at Saidpur to sign the documents when the students landed. The same thing happened with the 300nm solo flight mandatory for the advanced Commercial Pilot Licence. The students were required to fly on Rajshahi-Jashore-Saidpur-Rajshahi route and make full stops in the transit airports. But they instead flew from Rajshahi to Jashore and went back to Rajshahi, and then flew a round trip to Saidpur, BFA wrote to CAAB.  ""Due to shortage of endurance we had to return to Rajshahi for refuelling and restart for the second leg,"" it says. Aviation experts, however, say the academy could have refuelled at either Jashore or Saidpur using barrels of fuel and handpumps. The students flying the 150nm ""solo flights"" also had their teachers onboard with them, even though this was supposed to be unsupervised flights, meaning they flew their exam flight with help, documents show. ""From over-cautiousness of avoiding a situation/accident, which may cause suspension of flying training, sometimes solo flights were conducted with safety pilots onboard… The matter is highly regretted and will not be repeated in the future,"" the BFA letter reads. At least 22 students were given licences by CAAB–10 PPL and 12 CPL–after graduating from BFA even though they flew under supervision and did not follow the route. A glimpse into a meeting held at CAAB shows how, despite warnings by CAAB's safety departments, some of these students were given licenses by the regulatory body's high-ups. On May 21, 2024, members of CAAB's Flight Standards and Regulations Department arranged a meeting with the then licencing head to discuss whether they could accept reduced flying durations for two of those 22 cadet pilots from BFA. The meeting noted that ""flight time does not commensurate with the fulfilment of CPL skill test requirement"". However, the authorities later decided that ""considering previous practices"" and ""unavoidable circumstances"", as stated by BFA and Galaxy, the candidates should be granted the licence, according to CAAB documents. Both pilots were later granted CPLs, enabling them to be pilots for hire. One of these two pilots are currently employed at Biman in an assisting role, while the other is unemployed. Speaking anonymously, an official from one of the two academies told The Daily Star that his academy had indulged in these deviations because they did not want to bear the expenses of maintaining a set-up of engineers, pilots and refuelling facilities at the other airports. Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Hasan Imam Farazi, chief executive officer of Galaxy Flying Academy, said, ""We are aware of the problem and we can tell you that it will be resolved soon. Since the details are not finalised yet, I am not elaborating."" The Daily Star spoke to three BFA officials, including its chairman Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed, Bir Uttam, by phone and sent them questions via WhatsApp, but none of them agreed to speak on the record. However, one senior official, seeking anonymity, said, ""As this is an ongoing issue, we hope it will be resolved by the civil aviation authorities. So we would not comment on this issue at this time."" When cadet pilots finish their flying school and complete all checks, the respective academy applies for licences to CAAB on their behalf. CAAB then verifies the students' records and flight log, and grants the licence if they deem fit, aviation experts say. ""So the CAAB authorities cannot shrug off their responsibilities if students were granted licences without fulfilling their training requirements,"" said a CAAB official, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir Bhuiyan downplayed the training rules violation by the academies, and insisted that such violations do not raise safety concerns. ""This is not really a safety issue. We are carrying out a detailed study. This does not mean they cannot fly safely,"" he said. Asked whether CAAB would be legally liable if one of these pilots had an accident, he said, ""It is not really logical that a pilot who did not make a full stop landing in the third airfield in his early life will be involved in an accident."" Manjur, who assumed the role of CAAB chairman in August 2024, added that there has not been any violation that would constitute ""unsafe flying"" and that CAAB always complies with ICAO safety standards. ""Concerns will arise only if misinterpreted, misleading or wrong information is published. So far, we have not found any issue of potential Significant Safety Concern,""he told The Daily Star in a written response. Significant Safety Concern (SSC) status is a ranking given to a country's civil aviation by ICAO in case of major deficiencies in aviation safety oversight system. Bangladesh was under the SSC status in 2009-2012. Suspicious service Since 2017, an organisation named A4Aero Ltd has been conducting the written exams for the aspiring pilots. The tests are conducted through a software, which also scores the answer sheet and the CAAB automatically receives a copy of the results. The full ownership and control of the software remains with A4Aero. Even the data is stored in the cloud server of A4Aero, giving rise to the possibility of fraudulence and cheating, according to a report by a government agency. The ACC investigators, who visited the CAAB office on March 17, 2025, found that the public procurement rules were not followed when giving the job to A4Aero. CAAB is designated as a Critical Information Infrastructure by the government, meaning that the software it uses must undergo thorough quality testing by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Documents also show that the organisation was not even registered in 2017, the year it began taking the tests. It was registered on February 27, 2018. As of April 2024, it has taken 14,084 tests. The organisation is owned by Captain SM Nazmul Anam, a former flight safety director at CAAB. Talking to The Daily Star last week, he said that during his tenure at CAAB (2012-2015), Bangladesh came out of a ""Significant Safety Concern"" status assigned by the ICAO between 2009 and 2012. ""We began developing the software in 2017 because CAAB was struggling with question-paper leaks during its physical tests and we were encouraged to do so by CAAB. CAAB was supposed to formally procure the software but it never did. They have just been using it,"" said Nazmul, currently a Regional Officer for flight safety at ICAO's Asia-Pacific region. Asked whether CAAB has access to the data and control over the software, he said, ""The developers have left the company. I do not have the source code and neither does CAAB. The data is stored in the cloud server of my company."" Less than 24 hours before going to print – and four days after he was interviewed – he told this paper yesterday morning that he had found the source code and handed the database over to CAAB. During last week's interview, he said he pays for the cloud space himself, with expenses going up to $200 per month, and noted that since the code of the software has not been updated in years, it is a cyber security risk. ""Since we did not have an agreement with CAAB, this software has never been through any quality testing,"" he said. He however insisted that it is not possible to cheat using the software. The Daily Star visited the office address listed on the company's website last month, but could not locate the company there. When pointed this out, Nazmul said the company is fully remote, and has no physical office. CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal Md Manjur Kabir admitted that the software in question was under development and trial when A4Aero offered the service, but he denied that CAAB had no access control over it. Asked about the risk of using the software in cheating, he said, ""We have not so far received any formal complaints or proof of any kind of cheating in exams. However, CAAB is in the process of acquiring new software with full features for taking the test."""
"120","Families want closure, however painful","Sun Mar 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:01 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. This is the fourth and the last part of the series. Part 1- Hastily buried in unmarked graves Part 2 - AL govt sought to hide true extent of massacre Part 3 - A systematic cover up of bodies When we first started visiting Dhaka Medical College Hospital in January for this story, there were seven protest-related unclaimed bodies freezing in its mortuaries. One of them, Md Hasan, a teenage trader from Gulistan, was handed over to his family on February 14 after DNA tests.  The remaining six are still stored at DMCH morgue, growing colder. Hasan's father, Md Monir Hossain, had searched for his son everywhere -- hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, and even Anjuman Mufidul Islam since his son went missing on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fell and fled the country.  ""After four months, student leaders told me about the seven bodies at Dhaka Medical. I identified my son from his clothing. He always wore white."" Md Sogir from Sylhet believes his son, Md Waliullah, 25, a trader from Elephant Road in the capital, is also among the bullet-ridden bodies in the DMCH mortuary. ""My son went missing in July. I looked for him for five months. The bodies are barely recognisable, but I identified my son through an old surgery mark on his right leg."" Sogir has given his DNA sample to the Criminal Investigation Department of police and is awaiting confirmation.  A SYSTEM FAILING THE VICTIMS If the sample does not match and if no one comes looking for the rest of the bodies still freezing at DMCH, these men, who were once someone's family, will likely be buried as ""nobodies"" in unmarked graves like many others (read more in Part 1). On January 25, 2025, former information adviser Nahid Islam visited the Rayerbazar graveyard to pay tribute to the unidentified martyrs of the July uprising. There, Nahid, currently the leader of National Citizen Party, assured the families of these victims that efforts to identify those buried in unmarked graves had begun.  Nahid along with other student leaders visited the graveyard again on March 4 after the launch of the new party, and reiterated their commitment to identifying the graves of the unclaimed bodies. In reality, however, the process remains stuck in red tape. In November last year, the July Uprising Cell under the health ministry gave families only a 12-day window to report missing persons, posting an obscure notice on a barely visible website. The Cell claims it did not receive any missing reports yet. However, not a single of the 31 families we spoke to knew about this notice or the newspaper advertisements published by the cell. They don't even know where the office is. Mahbub Ullah Mazumder, senior assistant secretary of July Foundation, has made a list of the six that this investigation confirmed to have been buried in Rayerbazar and one missing protester from Anjuman documents. After Mahbub shared the list with the cell, it only sent a letter to relevant ministries for actions. Three government officials working on the July Uprising Cell said the health ministry is working to identify the missing bodies ""very seriously"" and asked The Daily Star to call health Secretary Md Saidur Rahman, who in turn advised us to contact Joint Secretary Dr SM Mustafizur Rahman. The joint secretary said the ministry sent a letter to the deputy commissioner's office to take action. Dhaka DC Tanvir Ahmed said they did not receive the letter yet. ""To exhume bodies from graves, the request needs to come from the relevant police stations based on cases filed in connection with the incidents. We did not receive any such request from the police stations either,"" Tanvir added. As the process remains stuck in the labyrinth of paper works involving a complex network of multiple government agencies, families of Sohel Rana, Faisal Sarker,  Md Assadullah, Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, Ahmed Jilani, and many other victims of the July massacre who remain missing, continue to look for answers. They want to know where exactly their loved ones lie among the 114 buried in Block 4 of Rayerbazar. These graves, each marked solely by a bamboo pole, leave the families with no way of knowing that. Meanwhile, rain has flattened the graves, and the bamboo markers are rotting. If a GD number, a photo, a birthmark, age, clothing or any previous injury marks had been placed on the bamboo pole before burying the unclaimed bodies, identifying them would have been easier. Now, if any relative claims a body, all the corpses would need to be exhumed for DNA profiling. ""Even if the identities of the unclaimed bodies are found, detection of the graves is challenging because they were buried collectively. There's no way of knowing who was buried where,"" said Kamrul Ahmed, head of Anjuman Mufidul Islam's burial service, who oversaw the burial of many July massacre victims.  Prof Kamrul Islam Sardar, who served as a forensic head at some of the top hospitals, said even if DNA samples were collected from every unclaimed body, they are now useless since the graves are unmarked. ""All the bodies would need to be exhumed for new DNA samples, and this would then need to be matched with relatives. This is a very complicated process which might take years if effective steps are not taken by the government to expedite the process,"" he added. Only six families among the many families know that their kin have been buried in Rayerbazar. One reason behind this is that many of the families we spoke to do not even know that places like Anjuman Mufidul or Rayerbazar exist. They tried to rely on the police, who, in many cases, offered little help. Ahmad Ferdous, head of CID's Forensic DNA Laboratory, said they completed 11 DNA profiling of as many victims related to the uprising. Of them, five bodies have been handed over to family members after the samples matched. The rest six remain unidentified as there are no claims for these bodies. DNA profiling for 10 more bodies connected to the uprising is currently underway, Ferdous added. Meanwhile, many families continue to gather at Dhaka Medical College morgue every day to find their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands among the six uprising-linked bodies still lying unclaimed there. Rasheda Begum, mother of Sohel Rana who was killed in police shooting and buried at Rayerbazar as an unclaimed body, keeps visiting Block 4 of the cemetery with teary eyes. ""Which one is my son's grave?"" she asks anyone who would listen. The families of Ridoy, Miraj, Maruf and many others want to know if they are dead or alive. For these families, uncertainty overshadows the agony of their loss. They now want closure, however painful. Assadullah's widow Farjana Akter is tormented every day as she cannot console her two children, aged ten and four. ""My children keep asking where their father's grave is. Since I cannot bring their father back alive, I at least want to show them where he rests, so they can have a place to grieve and remember him."" [Our correspondents from Gazipur, Bogura, Pabna and Thakurgaon contributed to this story.] WHERE ARE THEY?  Sohel Sheikh joined a victory procession on August 5 after Hasina fled the country.  He headed for Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the deposed prime minister, like tens of thousands of others. By 6:00pm, his wife, Ayesha Akhter, got a call—Sohel had been shot in front of Uttara East Police Station. Over a dozen died there as police opened fire on protesters trying to storm in. The caller told Ayesha that Sohel Sheikh was being taken to Crescent Hospital in Uttara. Defying the curfew, she came to Dhaka from Pirojpur, rented a house for two months and looked for her husband at Crescent and Dhaka Medical, but did not find him. Her initial attempt to file a case was also stalled by officers. Uttara East police eventually recorded a missing diary instead of a case and told her to omit that her husband was shot. Ayesha has no updates about the investigation. ""I abandoned all hopes. I  took out loans to stay in Dhaka and find him. No one helped me. I now live in Pirojpur with my in-laws,"" Ayesha said. The Daily Star spoke to the person who called Ayesha on August 5. He and multiple witnesses said Sohel Sheikh was shot. No one knows what happened next.  Shahidul Islam Miraj was enraged after watching the video of the police shooting of Abu Sayed on July 16. He shared the video and wrote several Facebook posts, and joined the protest the next day. His social media shows he was active in Jatrabari-Shonir Akhra area since July 17. His elder brother, Saiful Islam Mithil, warned him and asked him to stay home until normalcy returns. On July 27, Miraj left without telling his brother, and never came back. At least five protesters said they saw him at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5, but we could not independently verify this. That day, Jatrabari police killed protesters one after another like targets in a video game. For six months, Mithil looked for his brother in morgues, police stations, Anjuman Mufidul Islam and Rayerbazar graveyard. He just wants to know whether his brother is dead or alive.  HSC examinee Md Maruf, 17, went missing from Dhaka's Mirpur on July 20. That was the first full day of the curfew. After August 5, family filed a case with Rupnagar police station. But, there are no updates. When his mother demanded an update, officers told her that her son committed suicide. But there is no corpse. When we asked Investigating Officer Md. Ibrahim of Rupnagar police station on what basis he claims that Maruf died by suicide, he shrugged. ""I don't even know who Maruf is."""
"121","Hastily buried in unmarked graves","Wed Mar 12, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 02:21 PM","Mashfiq Mizan","Seven months after the July uprising in Bangladesh, many protesters still remain missing. We investigated 31 cases: six were buried as unclaimed bodies at Rayerbazar graveyard; four were identified by families from among the charred bodies in Ashulia; two were handed over to families after DNA testing; and 19 are still unaccounted for. We found evidence of systematic government efforts to cover up medical records and bodies of the victims so they can never be found again. This four-part series also documents how families were denied time to collect the corpses from hospital morgues, and how they are now waiting for the bodies of their loved ones. On July 18, 2024, two days after Abu Sayed's killing in Rangpur, Sohel Rana stepped out of his home in Dhaka's Jatrabari around 6:00pm to join the quota reform movement. He told his mother he would be back soon, but he never did. Around an hour after he joined the protest in Jatrabari area, police detained Sohel, 28, tortured him, and then shot him several times, four fellow protesters and a person who admitted him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital told The Daily Star. His inquest report, prepared by Shahbagh police, confirms he had multiple pellet wounds on both sides of his chest and bruises on different parts of his body. Faisal Sarker, 18, a college student who also worked as a supervisor of a bus company, left home for work at Abdullahpur bus stand in Uttara on July 19. By the time he got out, the crackdown on the streets was getting worse.  He called his mother to tell her that he was coming home, in Cumilla, to stay with her until the situation stabilised. His family last heard of him when he was crossing Uttara to get a bus. He then vanished. The same day in Uttara, Md Assadullah, a driver and a father of two, was shot by Awami League-affiliated helmeted assailants, according to CCTV camera footage and multiple still images verified by The Daily Star. Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah never knew each other in life. But their fates converged in death. Their bodies, along with many others, ended up at Dhaka Medical College morgue. Unidentified, unclaimed. A nationwide curfew, intended to quash the movement, kept their families from finding them, and the six were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves at Rayerbazar before their relatives could collect their bodies, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. Meanwhile, at least 19 more families we spoke to continue searching for their fathers, sons, brothers or husbands whom they lost during the July uprising. But they don't know if they will ever find them as there are hardly any efforts from the government to resolve the mystery of these missing men. At least 12 of these 19 people went missing on August 4 and 5 from Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur, Sirajganj, Panchagarh and Bogura amid clashes and police firing. The fact-finding report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited senior security officials' testimony, saying deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself ordered security forces to ""arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies."" However, there is no official account yet of how many bodies were actually hidden by the state apparatus. The Daily Star investigated 31 cases of unclaimed or missing bodies, but evidence suggests that the actual number is higher. Over the last two months, we have pieced together hospital records and police inquest reports as well as records from Anjuman Mufidul Islam, a charity for burial service, and Rayerbazar graveyard, and found evidence of deliberate attempts by state forces to kill protesters and hide their bodies. THE UNMARKED GRAVES Anjuman Mufidul Islam is the only burial service in the country that handles unclaimed bodies. We reviewed its register and found that the charity buried 515 bodies from January to November 2024, an average of 47 bodies per month.  However, the body count jumped after the middle of July. Only in the last 10 days of that month, when police, Rab, BGB, Ansar and armed forces members were called in to tackle the protesters, Anjuman sent 45 bodies for burial in the Rayerbazar graveyard, just two less than its monthly average. Anjuman's register shows it did not send a single body for burial from August 1 to 11, despite an intensified crackdown between August 2 and 5. But in the remaining 20 days, it buried 34 bodies. We went to see the burial sites at Rayerbazar on January 29. Block 4 of the cemetery contained 114 graves without names or any other identifiable markings. Grave staffers said many were victims of the July uprising, but could not give a figure. Analysing Rayerbazar's register, we found that 27 bodies buried in July and 13 in August had dates of death between July 17 and August 5, the final and the deadliest three weeks of Sheikh Hasina's 15-year authoritarian rule, when hundreds were killed and thousands injured by state forces. In addition to Sohel, Faisal and Assadullah, at least three more protesters – Rafiqul Islam, Mahin Mia, and Ahmed Jilani – now lie in Rayerbazar as unidentified bodies, The Daily Star can confirm. Photos of their bodies are still on display on a wall of Anjuman among the 114 buried in July-August. Of the 114, at least 40 died between July 17 and August 5 and the rest 74 before and after that period. Based on the dates of death of the 40, it is likely that many of them were victims of the July massacre. All the six July uprising victims that we have been able to identify went missing between July 18 and 20 in and around the protest hotspots—Jatrabari, Shonir Akhra, Uttara, and Mohammadpur, witnesses and family members said. Except Jilani, who was killed on August 3 and laid to rest on August 31, the rest were buried in July, within days of their deaths. Apart from Mahin, who went missing from Mohammadpur and taken to Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, the other five were brought to DMCH. When we met Sohel Rana's mother Rasheda Begum at her Jatrabari house in January, she clutched a picture of her son to her chest and wept. ""The night he disappeared, we kept our front door open, thinking he would come home at any moment. My son never came home. Now I cannot even find where among the 114 graves lies my son."" Read Part 2 tomorrow on the systematic efforts by state agencies to hide the true extent of the July massacre."
"122","How Hasina’s flight was kept off radar","Sat Sep 14, 2024 07:00 AM         Last update on: Sun Sep 15, 2024 03:48 PM","Zyma Islam","When the air force transporter plane carrying Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, it took off as a training flight and turned off its transponders to blur its flightpath and location. The transponders, which transmit location, heading, altitude and speed, and the automatic geolocator system, were not turned on until the aircraft was close to Indian airspace in West Bengal, several sources told The Daily Star . The Daily Star obtained a copy of flight AJAX1431's progress strip from air traffic control. The flight progress strip is a small card which the ATC use to track a certain plane in the air so that planes don't collide mid-air. This paper also obtained a recording of the radio communications between the cockpit of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft and the ATC in Dhaka. The flight progress strip shows that Hasina's plane took off from Dhaka's Bangabandhu Airbase, on the west of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, at 3:09pm. Just 30 minutes prior to this, tens of thousands of protesters took control of the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's then official residence. Army chief Waker Uz Zaman was initially scheduled to address the nation at 2:00pm to formally announce Hasina's resignation. This was later postponed to 3:00pm, but he eventually made his address around 4:00pm. In an interview with a New York-based nagoriktv.com in the last week of August, Waker said that he did not know that Hasina was flying away. ""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said. The plane turned on its transponders and automatic geolocator system when it reached waypoint ""BEMAK"" on Dhaka-Kolkata route. The aircraft suddenly showed up on radar. It first headed towards Kolkata before changing course for Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, 30km from the Indian capital, according to a screen grab of the radar screen at the Dhaka airport. Aviation experts said that it was likely that the plane made the detour, by going towards Kolkata first instead of flying straight to Delhi, because it wanted to spend as little time as possible in Bangladesh airspace. The Dhaka to Delhi route flies over Rajshahi and requires several minutes more in Bangladesh airspace than the Dhaka to Kolkata route. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha on August 6 that Hasina had sought approval to come to India on a ""short notice"". According to the flight progress strip, Indian authorities were notified of the plane entering its airspace. Hasina's flight was given squawk code 4131, a unique four-digit code assigned by the ATC to each aircraft operating in its airspace. Before taking off, the crew manually enters this code into the aircraft's transponder.  When a flight plan is approved, the code is sent to the destination air traffic controller, in this case it was Kolkata. Civil aviation sources said there is a direct hotline between Dhaka and Kolkata's air traffic control to notify each other about approaching planes. Even though the plane was invisible to secondary radar, used by ATCs, the cockpit crew maintained continuous communication with different air traffic controllers, including the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport's traffic controller, and most likely the Kolkata area air traffic controller. The recording of the radio communications between the C-130 and the ground controller at Dhaka reveals that flight AJAX1431 chose taxiway South Alpha to get on runway 32 from Bangabandhu Airbase. The ground controller warns the plane that two Antonov An-32s were there and to taxi with caution. The plane was later cleared for an initial altitude of 20,000 feet by the ATC. ""AJX 1431 […] cleared for take-off, after take-off, left-turn 238 [heading], continue climb [to] flight level 200 [20,000 feet], we are rolling,"" said the pilot as he repeated the controller's instructions as required and notified the ATC that the plane was taking off. The tower responded, ""Roger"" and Sheikh Hasina's flight was in the air.  After AJAX1431 crossed 4,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Dhaka area control centre. ""Dhaka control AJX 1431, crossing 110 [11,000 feet] continuing [to] 200 [20,000 feet] and we will be just 15 miles left deviation,"" informed the pilot. ""Fifteen miles left deviation approved,"" said the controller in Dhaka. The crew eventually sought clearance for 24,000 feet, which was approved by Dhaka ATC. The ATC then also alerted the cockpit crew about traffic, an Airbus A320 heading for Dhaka. It said the Airbus was above them and was descending to 26,000 feet. Soon afterwards, Dhaka ATC said, ""AJX 1431 change to Kolkata control"", which means it asked the crew to get in touch with the Kolkata area controller and announce its arrival. This is usually done when the flight is close to the border, sources said. Air Commodore AFM Atiquzzaman, member (operations & planning) at the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh was at the ATC tower when Hasina's plane took off. He saw the plane take to the sky. ""At that moment I had no idea who was inside that flight. I was there in the tower just doing my normal duty when I saw an Air Force training flight taking off. I did not know of course who was inside,"" Atiquzzaman told The Daily Star. According to a report of India Today, after Hasina's plane crossed the border, it was escorted by two Dassault Rafale fighter jets of the 101 squadron at Hashimara airbase in West Bengal. The fighters were waiting for the C-130. India Today on August 6 said the Indian authorities started monitoring the flight around 10km from the Indian border with Bangladesh. Sources claimed that neither Hasina, nor her sister Sheikh Rehana, or the flight crew and Special Security Force (SSF) members went through immigrations before departing Dhaka. Hasina was carrying a diplomatic passport, while Rehana had a British passport. According to Indian media, the plane landed at Hindon airbase at 6:15pm (Dhaka time). Hasina was then taken to a safe house provided by the Indian government in Noida, Uttar Pradesh province. The SSF members and the crew flew back to Bangladesh a day later."
"123","A councillor and his illicit tobacco trade","Sat Jun 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Wed Jun 12, 2024 09:28 PM","Mohammad Suman","A significant share of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette market is controlled by two companies where Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother have the majority stakes, an investigation by The Daily Star has found. These two companies – Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco – may have long been placing counterfeit banderoles on their cigarette packs and distributing them in different parts of the country, an ongoing investigation by NBR's Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) indicates.  Additionally, these two companies have been producing and selling various cigarette brands, including fake versions of foreign brands like Oris and Esse Lights in big cities such as Dhaka and Chattogram, multiple officials say on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the ongoing probe involving powerful people. On May 21, CIC and customs intelligence busted Bijoy International's office in Chakaria upazila in Cox's Bazar and recovered documents that point to the tobacco company's link with manufacturing cigarettes with illegally imported raw materials, according to documents and customs officials.  Earlier on May 9, customs intelligence raided another tobacco factory, Tara International Tobacco, where Liton has the majority share, documents show.  Company filings at the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) show that as of December 2020, Liton and his brother Abdul Mannan Khokon hold all 20,000 shares worth Tk 100 each of Bijoy. Until December 2020, the two brothers held 60 percent of the shares and another company held 40 percent. The private investment company then transferred its share to the two brothers on December 10, 2020, although it is yet to be approved by the RJSC, documents show. Under company law, transfer of share takes effect on the date of transfer, unless there are forgeries by the parties involved or incomplete documentation. However, the final completion of share transfer is subject to RJSC's approval, a company lawyer said. Liton, also acting convener of a port city unit Awami League, owns 70 percent share in Tara International Tobacco, a partnership set up in March 2017 with a proposed initial capital of Tk 40 lakh. The rest 30 percent share of the company is held by Omar Faruk Siddiki, also from Chattogram, documents show.  THE TOBACCO RACKET Analysing import and local purchase documents seized from Bijoy and Tara, CIC officials suspect both companies have been engaged in tax evasion through imports of raw materials for cigarette using non-existent and anonymous entities. Tobacco Tax Policy 2021-2030 strictly prohibits imports of tobacco raw materials by any entity other than cigarette manufacturers. In actuality, a number of trading companies have been importing various raw materials for cigarette, including the three essential components: acetate tow, unmanufactured tobacco, and cigarette paper. Acetate tow is the soft, cotton-like material used to make cigarette filters.  NBR data show at least 5,906 tonnes of raw materials used for cigarette production, including these three key components, have been imported by 11 trading companies in the last two years since February 2022 alone. None of these traders are manufacturers, and at least four of them supplied their illegal imports to Bijoy and Tara, officials say. The raw materials they imported are enough to produce at least 295 crore cigarette sticks, CIC officials tell The Daily Star, adding that the government lost at least Tk 1,500 crore in revenue from these cigarettes, as the companies did not pay any VAT and supplementary duty. Most of these raw materials came from China, Malaysia, Germany, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, documents show. These companies are SB Traders, M/s Anik Enterprise, Rapid Marketing, Rapid Pack Limited, M/s Osman Trading, RH Traders, Saad International, Alam Traders, AK Enterprise, Star Impex and CR7 Trading. CIC investigators say most of them are phantom companies, meaning they are being used as shell companies. The Daily Star went to the physical address of three companies in Dhaka and Chattogram, but did not find them. Between May 9 and May 21, a large quantity of equipment and raw materials used for cigarette production were seized from the warehouses of Rapid Pack Limited in Dhaka's Keraniganj and AK Enterprise in Chattogram. Customs officials have since shut the warehouses of both companies. During the raid, CIC and customs officials found Rapid Pack Limited had cigarette manufacturing equipment, although it has no permission to make them. The CIC officials' raid on Bijoy and Tara was based on the analysis of the import, purchase and sales records of Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise.  Documents show both Rapid Pack and AK Enterprise supplied their imported raw materials to Bijoy and Tara, which is illegal as only direct manufacturers can import such items. In the subsequent raid on Bijoy on May 21 by a joint team of CIC and port city customs intelligence, officials found documents related to its trade with Rapid Pack, Rapid Marketing, AK Enterprise and Alam Traders. Currently, 7.56 tonnes of cigarette foil paper inscribed with foreign brand ""Oris"" imported by AK Enterprise are being held by the Chattogram Customs. AK Enterprise falsely declared them as coated paper. During interrogation, AK Enterprise owner AKM Ziauddin told customs officials that he imported these products for Liton, who paid for the shipment in advance. Ziauddin told The Daily Star that the false declaration was unintentional. ""I imported the Oris brand foil paper from China for Tara International."" Talking to this newspaper, Liton admitted paying for the shipment. He denied that his factories make illegal products, but admitted buying Oris cigarette papers from AK Enterprise. He added that all related VAT and duties were paid during the production phase. Based on the information provided by Ziauddin, customs officials in a raid on Tara International on May 9 confiscated a significant amount of counterfeit Oris brand cigarettes made in Tara's factory in Bhairab of Kishoreganj. ""At least four of these 11 trading companies have illegally imported raw materials of cigarettes for Bijoy International Tobacco and Tara International Tobacco,"" a top CIC official said. Import data obtained from NBR show these four companies imported about 61 percent or 3,583 tonnes of the 5,906 tonnes of raw materials illegally shipped into the country in the last two years. Given the gravity of the matter, NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem on May 16 directed the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and VAT Intelligence to collaborate with the CIC to track down the ultimate beneficiaries of the illegal imports. Subsequently on May 19, NBR issued letters to all registered banks, asking them to provide all relevant bank documents and account information of the 11 entities as well as any associated individuals or entities. NBR officials say none of the 11 trading companies submitted their tax and VAT returns in the last two years, which is mandatory.  ILLEGAL MARKETING In December last year, local businessmen from different regions sent multiple letters to NBR, saying two cigarette brands named ""Express"" by Bijoy and ""Peacock"" by Tara were being distributed in rural areas of Chattogram, Khagracchari, Rangamati, Kurigram, Feni, Kushtia and Lalmonirhat with fake banderoles. The letters, seen by this newspaper, said 10-stick packs of Express and Peacock cigarettes were being sold for Tk 15-25, much lower than the government-set retail price of Tk 45 for a 10-stick pack. Many of these packs had no banderoles, while others had fake banderoles. Banderoles are the instrument used for controlling illicit tobacco trade and collecting tax revenue around the world. In Bangladesh, they are printed at the Government Security Printing Press in Dhaka. Liton admitted to selling his brands at low prices sometimes. An intelligence report sent to NBR in 2022 mentioned Bijoy, Tara and Liton by name, saying, ""There are allegations against Tara International Tobacco used fake banderoles in the past.""  'EXACTLY THE SAME' Port city's Riazuddin Bazar is a prominent wholesale market for cigarettes, including illegal ones. Three wholesale traders told The Daily Star that they have both the original and fake cigarettes of foreign brands, including Oris, Petron and Esse Lights. They said the demand for the fake ones is higher as they are cheaper. One trader gave a demonstration on how to spot the fake ones, saying almost no one can spot the difference. ""They look exactly the same, but the quality is different…. Once you open the pack, you get a foul smell that you do not get from the original ones,"" he said. Supply of some so-called foreign brands at Riazuddin Bazar drastically fell over the last two weeks after the raids at various suspicious tobacco factories, including the two owned by Liton. About buying cigarette raw materials from trading companies, Liton said, ""I don't have detailed information about their origins. I simply provide work orders, and they supply the raw materials."" The Oris brand cigarettes that the customs officials seized are of regular size, and not the slim ones like the original foreign brand, he said. ""The cigarettes produced under the brand name of Oris are popular, but I will stop producing them if the original Oris company raises any objections. The allegations of manufacturing Esse Lights, Oris and other slim cigarettes are baseless. I do not even have the equipment to make them,"" he said. But CIC officials say the quality of the Oris paper seized at his factory and those used in some slim Oris cigarettes that they collected from the market is similar.  ILLICIT CIGARETTE TRADE IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh is a fairly small player in illicit tobacco trade, but the trend is rising. Globally, illicit tobacco trade is estimated at about 10 percent of the total market size. Latest data on counterfeit cigarettes are not available, but a 2019 study by the World Bank Group shows Bangladesh's illicit cigarette trade in 2016-17 was roughly 2% of the total cigarettes sold in the market, or about 1.5 billion sticks. It was 50 percent for Latvia, 38 percent for Pakistan, 36 percent for Malaysia and 17 percent for India that year. In case of Bangladesh, the 2 percent illicit tobacco market share in 2016-17 was more than a three-fold growth from 2014-15, when the illicit tobacco market share was only 0.6%, the WB report said. About 92% of this illicit trade is in cigarettes that escape the tax net. The remaining 8% of contraband cigarettes are divided between smuggling and counterfeit products. The country loses about $100 million in revenue from the illicit cigarette trade annually, almost 4% of total tobacco revenues, the study found. However, NBR officials say that currently 8-10 percent of the cigarettes available on the market are illegal. And the racket involving Bijoy, Tara and some of the 11 trading companies under investigation controls a big chunk of this illegal tobacco market, they add."
